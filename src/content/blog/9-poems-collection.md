## Table of contents

## Idea of the Collection

A more concrete representation of how I would live my life without dogma but with sensibility and humanity. I started writing the first poem of the collection when I was defeated seeing great people struggling to bring felicity but failed due to the willingness, the circumstance, and the culture of the time. And through my own experience, I claim my own gain and expenditure, and I have a different value and love to share it with the world.

## Why in Chinese not English

I used to write poems in English starting at my 17. But, I found the reach, the extent, the style, and the purpose of how I love to embrace my artisitic value and life philosophy onto my poems would have a better delivery in Chinese than English. So, so.

## The Poems

行流如日雖逆理　依勢作遊甚可期

若濁其道謀殷勇　雍景難卻求絕壁

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

一方一點一心一失

二分二地二決二敗

三持三制三勢三守

四合四併四吞四吐

五連五散五眾五旗

六缺六易六動六靜

七離七解七異七常

八聚八集八左八右

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

珠峰之嶺滿腔血

千年風雪懷熱淚

不知歲月吹蒼訣

只見萬點匯常賢

## Where Are the Rest

8 finished. Not the right timing for the left ５ to be shown now. Though I uploaded those 8 to IPFS in a very private html url for historical storage. kkk.
